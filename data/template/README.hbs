I am working on program analysis and verification at [Galois](https://galois.com).

# Repositories

## Data Structures

Data structures that may be generally useful

- [haggle](https://github.com/travitch/haggle): A library providing multiple efficient graph implementations for Haskell [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haggle)
- [persistent-vector](https://github.com/travitch/persistent-vector): An implementation of persistent (i.e., purely functional) vectors based on array-mapped tries, based on the Clojure vector data structure [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-vector)
- [robbed](https://github.com/travitch/robbed): An implementation of Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams, which are canonical representations of boolean formulas that admit `O(1)` equivalence testing (but potentially exponential construction time)

## Program Analysis

- [build-bom](https://github.com/travitch/build-bom): A program that traces build systems to automatically produce LLVM bitcode for large programs or libraries, which is useful for source-based program analysis tasks
- [whole-program-llvm](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm): A set of scripts that can be used to hook build systems and generate LLVM bitcode for entire programs or libraries, which is useful for many source-based program analysis tasks; note that I consider this to be obsoleted by `build-bom`, which takes a more robust approach to the same problem
- [itanium-abi](https://github.com/travitch/itanium-abi): An implementation of C++ name demangling for ABIs that use the same name mangling strategy as the original Itanium ABI (most architectures for modern GCC and Clang, but not MSVC)
- [what4-serialize](https://github.com/GaloisInc/what4-serialize): A serializer of [what4](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/what4) expressions into a text format

## Binary Analysis

- [crepitans](https://github.com/travitch/crepitans): A scripting interface for binary analysis and symbolic execution
- [dismantle](https://github.com/travitch/dismantle): A collection of disassemblers for multiple architectures
- [portable-executable](https://github.com/GaloisInc/portable-executable): A parser for Portable Executable (Windows binary format) files
- [semmc](https://github.com/GaloisInc/semmc): A representation for semantics of machine code instructions, with a few different approaches to machine code synthesis
- [macaw](https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw): An implementation of multi-architecture binary code discovery with lifters into a symbolic execution engine
- [macaw-loader](https://github.com/GaloisInc/macaw-loader): A unified interface for loading binaries for analysis with macaw
- [renovate](https://github.com/GaloisInc/renovate): A multi-architecture binary rewriter

## Debugging Tools

- [ddmin](https://github.com/travitch/ddmin): An implementation of [Delta Debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_debugging) in Haskell
- [surveyor](https://github.com/GaloisInc/surveyor/): A symbolic debugger with a TUI for C/C++ (via LLVM bitcode) and binaries

## Solvers

Note that these are interesting and informative, but definitely not efficient enough to use in production

- [satisfaction](https://github.com/travitch/satisfaction): A SAT solver implemented in Haskell
- [datalog](https://github.com/travitch/datalog): A Datalog solver implemented in Haskell
- [ifscs](https://github.com/travitch/ifscs): A solver for Inductive Form Set Constraints implemented in Haskell

## Emacs Packages

- [haskell-pragma.el](https://github.com/travitch/haskell-pragma.el): A small Emacs package for easily adding pragmas to Haskell files without moving the point
- [haskell-interactive-import.el](https://github.com/travitch/haskell-interactive-import.el): A small Emacs package for easily adding imports to a Haskell file with completion, but without moving the point

## Maintainer

A collection of packages that I help maintain

- [abide](https://github.com/GaloisInc/abide): A machine encoding of machine-level ABIs as type transducers
- [elf-edit](https://github.com/GaloisInc/elf-edit): A parser for ELF binary files
- [flexdis86](https://github.com/GaloisInc/flexdis86): An x86 disassembler
