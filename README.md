I am working on program analysis and verification at [Galois](https://galois.com).

## Data Structures

Data structures that may be generally useful

- [haggle](https://github.com/travitch/haggle) [32 :star: [:book:](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haggle)]: An efficient graph library for Haskell
- [persistent-vector](https://github.com/travitch/persistent-vector) [22 :star: [:book:](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-vector)]: Persistent vectors for Haskell based on array mapped tries

## Debugging Tools

- [ddmin](https://github.com/travitch/ddmin) [3 :star:]: An implementation of delta debugging (ddmin) in Haskell
- [surveyor](https://github.com/GaloisInc/surveyor) [14 :star:]: A symbolic debugger for C/C++ (via LLVM), machine code, and JVM programs
- [binary-walkr](https://github.com/travitch/binary-walkr) [2 :star:]: A tool for examining ELF binaries

## Solvers

Note that these are interesting and informative, but definitely not efficient enough to use in production

- [satisfaction](https://github.com/travitch/satisfaction) [2 :star:]: A DPLL SAT solver written in Haskell
- [datalog](https://github.com/travitch/datalog) [95 :star:]: A pure Haskell implementation of Datalog
