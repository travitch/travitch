I enjoy building secure and correct systems.  I have built a number of static analysis and automated verification tools, with a recent focus on analysis of binaries.

## Data Structures

Data structures that may be generally useful

- [haggle](https://github.com/travitch/haggle) [39 :star: [:book:](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haggle)]: An efficient graph library for Haskell
- [persistent-vector](https://github.com/travitch/persistent-vector) [27 :star: [:book:](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent-vector)]: Persistent vectors for Haskell based on array mapped tries
